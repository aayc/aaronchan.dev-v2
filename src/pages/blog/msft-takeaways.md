title: "Three takeaways from my internship at Microsoft"
category: ""
--- 
I was a data science intern at Microsoft this summer, working on code completion models for VS Code and PowerShell.  If you're a developer, I hope I'll save you some typing :)

The biggest post-internship regret I usually have is, "Why didn't I talk to more people about deeper things?"  I always spend plenty of time asking questions about syntax, best practices, and strategy.  But, I often missed out on asking about life, experiences and values.  Asking my full time colleagues about that stuff seemed...awkward.

This summer I was determined to ask more questions that matter.  Here are three big takeaways that stuck with me from my conversations.

### Takeaway #1: I need to decide what I love to do.
I get excited about things really easily, which is good because it gives me drive, but it's bad because at the end of the day, I'm not sure what I'm "truly" passionate about.  I don't know how to pick.  I just want to be able to do everything.  Frontend, backend, machine learning, security, UX, research, entrepreneurship, you name it.

Let me warn you that I regret not picking, because now I realize that there are <b>big</b> advantages to picking what you want, and making that decision early.  Maybe this is an obvious lesson to many others, but it wasn't obvious to me.

First, being able to articulate a <b>specific</b> desired outcome for yourself will allow other people to open doors for you.  <b>If you're caught between going to graduate school and being an entrepreneur, people will help you with neither.</b>
But if you're all-in on graduate school then people will remember that.  If you're all in on Stanford, people will remember that even more, and they will call <b>you</b> when the Stanford headhunters come knocking.  If you're not specific about what you want, you will miss that call.

Second, having a specific thing you love to do will help you decide whether to say yes or no to opportunities and investments in yourself.  I have a bad habit of filling up my plate and telling myself that I can't miss all these great opportunities.  Instead, I unknowingly paid a different price: I gained all the short term rewards of learning, but fewer of the long term rewards of finishing.  If I continue to procrastinate being specific with what I want, I might wake up in 5 years and realize that I know a lot but haven't accomplished anything big.

Lately I've been struggling between focusing on graduate school and entrepreneurship during my next year in school.  Here's what helped me decide: if I could choose to get calls from friends, would I prefer those calls to be about interesting product ideas, or interesting research ideas?  Then it was clear: product ideas.  Would I rather have a great research paper or a small successful business?  Business, definitely.  So, I quit my research job.

### Takeaway #2: Stories are the key to presentations
The most frequent phrase I heard at MSFT in the Developer Tools division data science team regarding presentations was "telling stories."  People don't always understand data, but data tells stories, and people understand stories.

In school, I approach presentations with a rubric in hand.  I make sure that I speak clearly on each point required in the rubric.  In terms of grades, I usually do well in presentations, so I thought I was a great presenter.
Except, real presentations aren't about grades - they're about stories.  I don't think I've ever been graded on how well I told the story, or how engaging and informative my presentation was.

Once I figured this out, it was so much more obvious that the effectiveness of a great engineer is multiplied by also being a great storyteller and copywriter.  Just as the ability to advertise is complemented by a deep knowledge of how the product works, likewise great engineering is complemented by the ability to express the story behind the product.

Stories are also the key to metrics.  I never want to be in a position where the fact that I didn't include a particular metric makes it obvious that I didn't understand my own story of the presentation.  Because if I did understand the story, I would have had that metric, or at least a next step to obtain it.

### Takeaway #3: Compassion compounds
Imagine a meeting where a coworker, Tom, doesn't see eye to eye with you on a certain issue.  You argue about it, but neither of you budge.  The meeting runs out of time and everybody leaves.

Later, your coworkers ask you what's wrong.  In the worst case, you explode about Tom, talking about how his approach is going to cost everyone's time and money, and why does he even work here anyway?  In the better case, you could talk about the issue at hand while not gossiping.  But you'll always wonder what Tom's saying behind your back.  Imagine this continuing to fan out among the workplace.  It's distracting, and it'll cause issues far down the line.

Now flip the scenario.  You and Tom disagree, but you have the compassion to stop and understand Tom's point of view.  He stops and understands yours, and the situation de-escalates.  Picture that post-meeting chat again.  Now you're saying things like "I'm glad we have diverse perspectives around here."  Tom is talking about how you had the grace and tact to bring everyone back down to earth.  Imagine this fanning out in the workplace.  It'll bring benefits far down the line.

This is the kind of thing that I will pay attention to when I'm evaluating my leaders.  Do they have both the courage of their convictions and also the compassion required to understand their coworkers?  Do they have a clear vision of everyone's shared goal?  Before, I hadn't really thought about it.  There were some leaders I liked and others I didn't like and I wasn't sure why.  I think that knowing why is an important step to joining good teams, and becoming the kind of person and leader that I look up to.

Thanks for reading :) I hope that you enjoyed my takeaways and learned something too!
