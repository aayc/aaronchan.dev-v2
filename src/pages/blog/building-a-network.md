I recently gave a lecture as a guest speaker at the BYU + Dartmouth university Women's in CS clubs (I am not a woman, but I was very proud to be invited), speaking on technical career preparation.

I remember one of the most mysterious aspects of career preparation to me was building my "network." I would be at an event and I would remind myself that I should "talk to people" in order to "build my network." But talk to people about what? And will I really feel comfortable reaching out to those people just because I said hi at a party?

From my limited experiences in actual networking, I've discovered that it's actually a lot simpler. Two of the most useful tools for networking are a) investing in other people and b) following up with people when I do something related to what they're doing, or what we've done together in the past.

## Investing in other people

I used to hear the advice that I should find a mentor. I immediately assumed that meant asking someone to be my mentor. But it turns out that asking someone to be my mentor is pretty awkward. It's been a lot more straightforward to simply invest in other people first, which builds a real relationship and foundation of trust. By investing in someone else, I mean anything from helping a classmate with their homework, to knocking on a professor's door and sharing some honest, appreciative/constructive feedback about the class, to offering a business some ideas or a small offering of a product they could use. How much more likely do you think the recipient will be, when you show up and ask them for help? Way more.

Some people will take advantage of me for this kind of giving attitude. But that's okay, because I still chose to help them and I feel good about that so long as I am watchful against being manipulated.

## Following up with people

Every so often, someone will text me out of the blue just to say thanks for something that I did for them a long time ago, or that they are working on something related to something we worked on together. I have always appreciated and been really happy to receive these texts, and I always take the time to catch up with that person, ask them what they're working on, offer my advice, get their advice on my projects, and so on. What if I was the one reaching out? What if I was having 20, 30 of these conversations every week?

It seems so simple, but honest, appreciative follow up with people that have helped me in the past has helped me keep my relationships healthy, and opened doors that I never knew existed. My work with NASA, my consulting gigs, my small projects working along great people that have launched, were almost all started by these sorts of conversations.

Overall in my opinion and experience, if you're a genuine person looking to help others succeed, and you remember others when you have success or when you're working on something interesting, you are well on your way to having a strong network that will be a source of fulfillment to you and your work.
